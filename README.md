- Added quality-of-life functions to the Applications page (Renamed certain items to seem more "official", added "Addons" & "Scripts" buttons, "Dashboard" button, "Xbox Live" (Network Settings) button, and "Detach Virtual Disk").
  
- Added quality-of-life functions to the Media page (added Video/Music/Photo add-ons!)
  
- Neon wallpapers have been swapped out for pastel abstract shapes (based off of old macOS 9 wallpapers), making the UI easier on the eyes.
