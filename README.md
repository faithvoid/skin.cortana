# Cortana - A modern, sleek Xbox 180 style theme for XBMC4Xbox, with Cortana Server Browser built-in for Insignia/XLink Kai support.
## Requires ["Cortana Server Browser"](https://github.com/faithvoid/script.cortanaserverbrowser) && ["Cortana Chat"](https://github.com/faithvoid/script.cortanachat) to function correctly!

## Features:
- Replaced the broken Weather page with Cortana, a series of scripts that allows you to view & join active Insignia/XLink Kai sessions, events, view server statistics, get new match notifications, get Cortana/Insignia/XLink Kai news, check your Insignia DNS settings, send/receive messages, and more!
  
- Added quality-of-life functions to the Applications page (Renamed certain items to seem more "official", added "Addons" & "Scripts" buttons, "Dashboard" button, "Xbox Live" (Network Settings) button, and "Detach Virtual Disk").
  
- Added quality-of-life functions to the Media page (added Video/Music/Photo add-ons!)
  
- Neon wallpapers have been swapped out for pastel abstract shapes (based off of old macOS 9 wallpapers), making the UI easier on the eyes.
  
- Reintroduced Gamertag function from MC360! (Name & Avatar are automatically pulled from current XBMC profile, and you can manually edit your Rep, Gamerscore & Zone in Cortana Settings!) 
  
- Need to fix something? Cortana Settings Menu has you covered! With shortcuts to the Dashboard, Internet Connection Test utilities, Notification Settings, Clear Cache, XBMC4Gamers Scripts, Updates, and more, Cortana can help you out of most pickles!

- "Guide button" feature that allows you to quickly check messages in Cortana Chat!

## Bugs:
- Cortana blade is currently a bit visually glitchy and visibly says "Refresh" when switching pages. It's a "blink and you'll mix it" issue but it's still present. 
- You tell me.
