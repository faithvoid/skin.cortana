# Cortana - A modern, sleek Xbox 180 style theme for XBMC4Xbox, with an emphasis on social / multiplayer feature integration.
## Requires [Cortana Server Browser](https://github.com/faithvoid/script.cortanaserverbrowser), [Cortana Chat](https://github.com/faithvoid/script.cortanachatv2), [Cortana Wireless (optional)](https://github.com/faithvoid/script.cortanawireless) & [xSky](https://github.com/faithvoid/plugin.programs.xSky) to function correctly!

## Features:
- Replaced the broken Weather page with Cortana, a series of scripts that allows you to view & join active Insignia/XLink Kai sessions, events, view server statistics, get new match notifications, get Cortana/Insignia/XLink Kai news, check your Insignia DNS settings, send/receive messages, and more!

- Get social on your Xbox again! Using Cortana Chat, you can use the AT protocol (aka Bluesky) to chat with fellow gamers, invite them to games, set beacons to find other players, and more!

- Paired with Cortana Wireless, you can easily connect a Raspberry Pi or similar SBC as a wireless network card for your Xbox and easily manage your Wi-Fi settings!

- Per-profile save games and social features! Share your Xbox with friends and family? Everyone gets their own accounts and saves!

- "Guide button" feature that reimplements most of the features you know and love from the 360, using Cortana Chat! Just click in the right stick and you have full access to social features, settings, and more!

- Toast notifications for messages and notifications via Cortana Chat, and toast notifications for current XLink Kai / Insignia sessions via Cortana Server Browser!
  
- Added quality-of-life functions to the Applications page (Renamed certain items to seem more "official", added "Addons" & "Scripts" buttons, "Dashboard" button, "Xbox Live" (Network Settings) button, and "Detach Virtual Disk").
  
- Added quality-of-life functions to the Media page (added Video/Music/Photo add-ons!), as well as watched media indicators that were missing from the original JX 720!
  
- Neon wallpapers have been swapped out for pastel abstract shapes (based off of old macOS 9 wallpapers), making the UI easier on the eyes.
  
- Reintroduced Gamertag function from MC360! (Name & Avatar are automatically pulled from current XBMC profile, and you can manually edit your Rep, Gamerscore & Zone in Cortana Settings in the Guide menu!) 
  
- Need to fix something? Cortana Settings Menu has you covered! With shortcuts to the Dashboard, Internet Connection Test utilities, Notification Settings, Clear Cache, XBMC4Gamers Scripts, Updates, and more, Cortana can help you out of most pickles!

## TODO:
- Integrate some sort of homebrew download utility, maybe labelled "Cortana Marketplace"?
- Fix wallpaper memory usage bug.
- Fix up & release Cortana Server Browser & Cortana Chat.
- Try to reverse engineer the Kai Engine API?
- Fix multi-user savegame script.

## How to install:
- Download latest release from the Releases category
- Copy "Cortana" to "Q:\skins\", and "Cortana Server Browser" into your scripts folder.
- Change your skin to Cortana in the XBMC Appearance menu.
- ???
- Profit!

## Bugs:
- Cortana blade is currently a bit visually glitchy and visibly says "Refresh" when switching pages. It's a "blink and you'll mix it" issue but it's still present. 
- You tell me.
