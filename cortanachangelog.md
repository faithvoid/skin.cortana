# Changes from JX720 to Cortana - February 2025

- Replaced Weather blade with "Cortana", an Xbox Live style social page with current original Xbox news, social feature integration via Cortana Chat (an AT Protocol / Bluesky-based messaging solution designed to replicate most of the Xbox 360's social functionality), Insignia and XLink Kai integration, Xbox Video Chat integration, and more.
- Reimplemented Gamertags from MC360 as "Cortana IDs", as well as the ability to pull the relevant gamerscore/reputation data from Xbox Live
- Reimplemented "Watched" option for media (was absent from JX720 due to the author's personal preferences)
- Games blade now has different entries for Games, Demos, Arcade Programs, Saved Games, File Manager, Marketplace, and Favourites. Programs also now has "Add-ons" and "Scripts" as submenu options.
- Media blade now has "Add-ons" under Videos, Music and Pictures entries, as well as Favourites.
- Profile settings menu has been modified to allow logging in/out of Cortana Chat, modifying your Cortana ID gamerscore/reputation, or editing your Insignia account profile via the Xbox Online Dashboard!
- Settings menu now has "Cortana Settings", which contains useful utilities such as storage management, enabling/disabling notifications for Cortana Chat / Insignia / XLink Kai on startup, modifying skin options, internet connection / speed tests, and system information!
- The guide menu system has been fully reworked, containing the following entries: "Social" (for messages, notifications, friends, beacons & activity, etc.), "Matchmaking" (for Insignia / XLink Kai), "Favourites", "Power & Settings", and additional options for controlling media and discs when detected.
- Made and replaced a ton of icons.

## Cortana Settings:
- "Memory" has been added to "Cortana Settings", which allows the user to see at a glance how much free/total/used space they have on each partition, and easily rip CDs/DVDs directly to their HDD, or install/eject virtual game discs (such as .XISOs or .CCIs)
- "Network Settings" has been added to "Cortana Settings", which allows the user to test their internet connection and speed, connect to wireless networks (via Cortana Wireless), update Cortana / XBMC, or run the Insignia Setup Assistant utility!

## Insignia Integration:
### Insignia support has been integrated in the following ways:
- Cortana Server Browser has been integrated into Cortana, which allows you to view active Insignia sessions, events, and statistics, as well as directly launch games from the Sessions menu!
- A shortcut for the Insignia Setup Assistant has been added to "Network Settings", under "Cortana Settings".
- An "Insignia" option has been added to the Profiles settings menu, which opens the Xbox Online Dashboard, which allows you to add/remove/edit your Insignia account on your console.
- "Network Settings" in "Cortana Settings" contains a Connection Test utility, which checks your current local IP, external IP, and whether or not your DNS is properly resolving to Insignia.
- "Video Chat" has been added to the Cortana blade, which uses Xbox Video Chat to let you voice/video chat with other Insignia users! (Requires a copy of Xbox Video Chat and an original Xbox webcam, or a modded PS2 EyeToy)

## XLink Kai Integration:
### XLink Kai support has been integrated in the following ways:
- A script is currently in the works called "XLink Revived", which integrates basic features such as joining arenas back into XBMC. Currently waiting on CrunchBite (shoutout to him!) to provide a way to grab available arenas via the Kai Engine REST API and this should be good enough for release!
- Cortana Server Browser has been integrated into Cortana, which allows you to view active XLink Kai sessions, events, and statistics, as well as directly launch games from the Sessions menu!
