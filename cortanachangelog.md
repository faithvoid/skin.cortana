# Changes from JX720 to Cortana

- Replaced Weather page with "Cortana", an Xbox Live style social page with current original Xbox news, social feature integration via Cortana Chat (an AT Protocol / Bluesky-based messaging solution designed to replicate most of the Xbox 360's social functionality), Insignia and XLink Kai integration, Xbox Video Chat integration, and more.
- Reimplemented Gamertags from MC360 as "Cortana IDs", as well as the ability to pull the relevant gamerscore/reputation data from Xbox Live
- Reimplemented "Watched" option for media (was absent from JX720 due to the author's personal preferences)
- Games blade now has different entries for Games, Demos, Arcade Programs, Saved Games, File Manager, Marketplace, and Favourites. Programs also now has "Add-ons" and "Scripts" as submenu options.
- Media blade now has "Add-ons" under Videos, Music and Pictures entries, as well as Favourites.
- Profile settings menu has been modified to allow logging in/out of Cortana Chat, modifying your Cortana ID gamerscore/reputation, or editing your Insignia account profile via the Xbox Online Dashboard!
- Settings menu now has "Cortana Settings", which contains useful utilities such as storage management, enabling/disabling notifications for Cortana Chat / Insignia / XLink Kai on startup, modifying skin options, internet connection / speed tests, 
- Cortana Settings menu 

## Insignia Integration:
### Insignia support has been in the following ways:
- Cortana Server Browser has been integrated into Cortana, which allows you to view active Insignia sessions, events, and statistics, as well as directly launch games from the Sessions menu!
- A shortcut for the Insignia Setup Assistant has been added to "Network Settings", under "Cortana Settings".
- An "Insignia" option has been added to the Profiles settings menu, which opens the Xbox Online Dashboard, which allows you to add/remove/edit your Insignia account on your console.
- "Network Settigns" in "Cortana Settings" contains a Connection Test utility, which checks your current local IP, external IP, and whether or not your DNS is properly resolving to Insignia.

## XLink Kai Integration:
### XLink Kai support has been in the following ways:
- A script is currently in the works called "XLink Revived", which integrates basic features such as joining arenas back into XBMC. Currently waiting on CrunchBite (shoutout to him!) to provide a way to grab available arenas via the Kai Engine REST API and this should be good enough for release!
- Cortana Server Browser has been integrated into Cortana, which allows you to view active XLink Kai sessions, events, and statistics, as well as directly launch games from the Sessions menu!
